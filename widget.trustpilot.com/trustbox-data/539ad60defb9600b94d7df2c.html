Rating System Needed","text":"Most all of our pet sitters have taken great care of our puppies. However, the 5 star rating system is faulty. We want to make sure the truly great pet sitters get the recognition they deserve and 5 stars doesn't do that.
Trusted Housesitters uses five categories to rate a pet sitter (with a rating of 1 to 5 stars each), which is sufficient. However, there needs to be more stars available per category. We've given two pet sitters four stars on one category (one let our
dogs off leash on the road and also near a pond where there are alligators; another one left our kitchen floor and microwave filthy). When these two sitters saw the one category with a 4 star rating, they replied to our rating with hostility. They did
not deserve to have the same 5 star rating on all five categories like our other pet sitters. I've written to Trusted Housesitters about this (e.g., having more than 5 stars available so that you can really differentiate between pet sitters) but nothing
has changed yet. It's time for us to renew our membership but we're having second thoughts about renewing because we are unable to discern which pet sitters are truly great.","reviewUrl":"https://uk.trustpilot.com/reviews/6681aee2ec5ac04fba552592","verification":{"createdAt":"2024-06-30T21:15:46Z","isVerified":false,"reviewSource":"Organic","verificationSource":"invitation","verificationLevel":"not-verified"},"consumer":{"displayName":"Deb
